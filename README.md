# ZenSync3
Windows version of the Zenfolio rsync-like application

ZenSync2 is a PHP script used to sync a directory tree of images (and now videos) to the Zenfolio image hosting service.

ZenSync3 is an attempt to create a Windows (and potentially Mac/Linux if I ever get to try Xamarin) application that will
be a more reliable replacement for that.  ZenSync2 has aged (7 years!) and appears to be broken on Windows (32-bit
integers in PHP is the most likely culprit).
